# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-First Development
All content and features begin with a detailed specification before implementation. Every chapter, section, and interactive element must have a clear, documented purpose and educational objective before code is written. Specifications serve as the single source of truth for all development activities.

### II. Educational Clarity Over Technical Sophistication
Content must prioritize beginner-friendly explanations while maintaining technical accuracy. Complex concepts are broken down into digestible modules with practical examples. Educational value takes precedence over showcasing advanced technical implementations.

### III. Modularity and Reusability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every content module, code example, and interactive component must be designed for reuse across different sections of the textbook. Content is structured in discrete, self-contained units that can be combined in various ways to support different learning pathways.

### IV. AI-Native Integration
The textbook is designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and AI assistants. Content structure, metadata, and formatting support intelligent querying and contextual responses for the secondary chatbot functionality.

### V. Hardware and Robotics Fact Accuracy
All robotics and hardware information must be verified against authoritative sources. No speculation or hallucination about robotic capabilities, sensors, actuators, or physical AI principles. Technical facts are sourced and cited appropriately.

### VI. Course Alignment
All content strictly adheres to the official "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course outline. Deviations require explicit justification and approval. Educational objectives align with the curriculum's stated learning outcomes.

## Technology Stack Requirements

### Primary Technologies
- Content must be authored in Markdown with structured metadata
- Interactive elements implemented with web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Backend services for RAG integration use modern frameworks appropriate for the hackathon
- All code examples must be executable and tested in the specified development environment

### Content Standards
- Modular content structure supporting multiple presentation formats
- Consistent terminology and notation throughout the textbook
- Accessibility compliance for diverse learning needs
- Cross-platform compatibility for maximum reach

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
- All chapters begin with detailed specifications outlining learning objectives, prerequisites, and assessment criteria
- Content undergoes peer review focusing on educational effectiveness and technical accuracy
- Interactive elements are prototyped and tested with target audience before integration
- Regular synchronization between textbook content and RAG system indexing

### Quality Assurance
- Educational effectiveness validated through learning assessments
- Technical accuracy verified by subject matter experts
- Code examples tested in target environments
- Accessibility and usability requirements met for all interactive components

### Collaboration Protocols
- Contributions aligned with established educational philosophy
- Technical implementations follow agreed architectural patterns
- Regular reviews ensure content consistency across modules
- Feedback from early adopters incorporated iteratively

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook development. All contributors must understand and abide by these principles. Changes to this constitution require explicit approval from the project leadership team with clear justification tied to educational or technical objectives.

All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with constitutional principles. Complexity must be justified by clear educational or functional benefits. Use this document as the primary guidance for all development decisions.
