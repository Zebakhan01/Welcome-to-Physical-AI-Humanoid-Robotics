# Gazebo Module

## Overview

The Gazebo module provides an in-depth exploration of the Gazebo simulation environment for robotics. This module builds upon the simulation concepts introduced in Week 10, diving deeper into advanced simulation techniques, plugin development, and integration with ROS 2.

## Module Structure

This module covers several key areas of Gazebo simulation:

- **Gazebo Models**: Creating and using robot models in simulation
- **Gazebo Plugins**: Developing custom plugins for simulation
- **Gazebo Environments**: Creating complex simulation worlds
- **Gazebo Integration**: Connecting Gazebo with ROS 2

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, students will be able to:

- Create detailed robot models for Gazebo simulation
- Develop custom Gazebo plugins for specialized functionality
- Design complex simulation environments
- Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2 for robot development
- Optimize simulation performance and accuracy

## Prerequisites

Students should have foundational knowledge of:
- Basic simulation concepts (covered in Week 10)
- XML and SDF format basics
- C++ programming for plugin development
- ROS 2 integration concepts

## Module Approach

This module takes a practical, hands-on approach to learning Gazebo simulation with:
- Detailed model creation examples
- Plugin development tutorials
- Integration with ROS 2 systems
- Performance optimization techniques
- Best practices for simulation development
