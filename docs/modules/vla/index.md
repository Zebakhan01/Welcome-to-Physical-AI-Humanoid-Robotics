# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

## Overview

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module explores the integration of visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action in robotic systems. VLA represents a paradigm shift in robotics where robots can understand and execute complex tasks described in natural language while perceiving and interacting with the physical world. This module covers the theoretical foundations, architectures, and practical implementations of VLA systems.

## Module Structure

This module covers several key areas of Vision-Language-Action systems:

- **VLA Foundations**: Core concepts and theoretical background
- **VLA Architectures**: System architectures and design patterns
- **VLA Training**: Methods for training VLA systems
- **VLA Deployment**: Practical deployment considerations

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, students will be able to:

- Understand the principles of Vision-Language-Action integration
