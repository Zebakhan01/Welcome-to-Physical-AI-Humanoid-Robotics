# ROS 2 Module

## Overview

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) module provides an in-depth exploration of the next-generation robotics framework. This module builds upon the ROS fundamentals introduced in Week 9, diving deeper into advanced concepts, best practices, and implementation strategies specific to ROS 2.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several key areas of ROS 2 development:

- **ROS 2 Basics**: Core concepts and architecture differences from ROS 1
- **ROS 2 Packages**: Advanced package management and build systems
- **ROS 2 Launch**: Complex system launching and configuration
- **ROS 2 Actions**: Advanced communication patterns for robotics
- **ROS 2 Navigation**: Integration with navigation systems

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, students will be able to:

- Implement complex ROS 2 systems with proper architecture
- Design efficient communication patterns using ROS 2 features
- Configure and launch multi-robot systems
- Integrate ROS 2 with simulation and real hardware
- Apply ROS 2 best practices for production robotics

## Prerequisites

Students should have foundational knowledge of:
- Basic ROS concepts (covered in Week 9)
- C++ and Python programming
- Linux command line operations
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts

## Module Approach

This module takes a practical, hands-on approach to learning ROS 2. Each section includes:
- Theoretical concepts and principles
- Practical implementation examples
- Best practices and design patterns
- Integration with other robotics systems
- Performance and safety considerations
